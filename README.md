# 📚 Online Book Store Analysis (SQL Project)

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes an **Online Book Store** database using SQL. The dataset is structured across three CSV files — **Books**, **Customers**, and **Orders** — with common keys (`Book_ID`, `Customer_ID`). The goal is to answer both **basic** and **advanced business queries** that provide insights into sales, inventory, customer behavior, and revenue.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a relational schema from the provided CSV files  
- Write SQL queries to solve **business requirements**  
- Generate insights into **books, customers, and orders**  
- Demonstrate proficiency in **joins, aggregations, subqueries, and window functions**  
- Provide a foundation for **BI dashboards** in Power BI/Tableau
